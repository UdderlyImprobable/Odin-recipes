  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Today's recipe is a special kind of corn pudding common in Nigeria. It's local names include Akamu by the Igbos,
    Ogi by the Yorubas and generally Pap in Nigeria. It is very similar to the British custard which is made from
    dehydrated cornstarch with some added flavors. <br>

    The major difference between the two puddings is in the production phase. The corn kernels from which the cornstarch
    is collected undergoes a fermentation process during the production of Akamu whereas the kernels used for custard is
    unfermented.</p>
